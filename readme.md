# Wearable

At CSULB, Women in Computing (WiC) holds an annual hackathon named MarinaHacks, where you're given 12 hours to create a project and submit it for judging.

Our project, Wearable, won 1st place in the Entertainment category of the 2022 hackathon.

Although mostly disfunctional, our project showcased a fun proof of concept for trying on different colored shirts using Haar Cascades.
